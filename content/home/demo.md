Our lab focuses on the intersection between macroecology and macroevolution, considering macroecological patterns under an evolutionary perspective and evolutionary patterns and processes on a spatial context. In short, we work with macroecological theory and methods integrating macroecology with phylogenetic approaches to understand geographic patterns of biodiversity. We are based at the <a href="http://www.inecol.mx/inecol/index.php/es/ct-menu-item-25/investigacion/146-biologia-evolutiva">Evolutionary Biology Network</a> of <a href="http://www.inecol.mx/inecol/index.php/es/">Instituto de Ecología, A.C.</a>. We are also part of the Ecology & Evolution and Animal Biodiversity Graduate Programs of the Universidade Federal de Goiás (UFG), Brazil. In addition, we participe in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ecolgeo/inicio">Applied Geographical Ecology group</a> and <a href="http://www.red-bion.ikiam.edu.ec/">Latin American Network for the study of Neotropical Biogeography (Red-Bion)</a></p>
