abstract = "Only a small fraction of the species on Earth is known (Linnean
   shortfall), while geographic ranges of already described species are
   poorly documented (Wallacean shortfall). While the effect of both
   shortfalls in conservation assessments has been analyzed and discussed
   individually, it is still unclear how these knowledge shortfalls
   interplay affect our perception of species' exposure to human-driven
   changes. To asses this, by simulating virtual species in a
   geographically-fragmented ecoregion, we raised hypothetical scenarios of
   taxonomical and/or geographical knowledge accumulation through time. We
   described how such accumulation affects our percep-tion of species'
   exposure to climate and land-use changes. We found that filling both
   Wallacean and Linnean shortfalls separately, could generate contrasting
   perceptions on the potential response of species to a given threat.
   Moreover, the filling of both gaps together would increase or decrease
   our risk perception depending, exclusively, on the trend of taxonomic
   changes. These findings highlight a clear but poorly considered
   interplay between Linnean and Wallacean shortfalls. Trends on basic
   knowledge accumulation for a given taxon, especially its taxonomic
   stability, will determine the degree and direction of our biases in
   estimating its exposure to human threats. Robust assessments of
   taxonomic effort and geographic ignorance are essential in conservation
   assess-ments. There is also a pressing need to bridge the gap between
   taxonomic and biogeographic efforts, taking into account the interplay
   between geographic and taxonomic knowledge deficits, to achieve accurate
   conservation assessments and resource allocations."
