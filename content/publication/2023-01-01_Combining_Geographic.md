abstract = "Biotic interactions are a key component of the proper functioning of
   ecosystems. However, information on biotic interactions is spatially and
   taxonomically biased and limited to several groups. The most efficient
   strategy to fill these gaps is to combine spatial information (species
   ranges) with different sources of information (functional and field
   data) to infer potential interactions. This approach is possible due to
   the fact that there is a correspondence between the traits of two
   trophic levels (e.g., predator and prey sizes are correlated).
   Therefore, our objective was to evaluate the performance of the joint
   use of spatial, functional and field data to infer properties of the
   predator-prey interaction for five neotropical cats. To do this, we used
   presence-absence matrices to obtain lists of potential prey species per
   grid-cell for each predator range. These lists were filtered according
   to different criteria (models), and for each model, an interaction
   property was estimated and compared with field observations. Our results
   show that the use of functional information and co-occurrence allows us
   to generate values similar to those observed in the field. We also
   observed that there were differences in model performance related to the
   intrinsic characteristics of the predator (body size) and the
   interaction property being evaluated."
