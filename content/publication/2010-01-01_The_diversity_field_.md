abstract = "Aim
   To analyse how the patterns of species richness for the whole family
   Phyllostomidae determine the structure of diversity fields (sets of
   species-richness values) within the ranges of individual bat species.
   Location
   The range of the family Phyllostomidae in North and South America.
   Methods
   We generated a database of the occurrence of 143 phyllostomid bat
   species in 6794 quadrats, analysing the species-richness frequency
   distribution for all sites, and for subsets of sites defined by the
   geographic ranges of species. Range-diversity plots, depicting
   simultaneously the size and the mean species richness of ranges, were
   built to explore the patterns of co-occurrence in widespread and
   restricted species. We compared the empirical patterns against two null
   models: (1) with scattered (non-cohesive) ranges, and (2) with cohesive
   ranges modelled with the spreading-dye algorithm. Diversity fields were
   analysed with richness maps for individual species and with comparisons
   of species-richness frequency distributions.
   Results
   Overall richness frequency distribution showed a multimodal pattern,
   whereas simulated distributions showed lower values of variance, and
   were unimodal (for model 1) and bimodal (for model 2). Range-diversity
   plots for the empirical data and for the cohesive-ranges simulation
   showed a strong tendency of species to co-occur in high-diversity sites.
   The scattered-ranges simulation showed no such tendency. Diversity
   fields varied according to idiosyncratic features of species generating
   particular geographic patterns and richness frequency distributions.
   Main conclusions
   Phyllostomid bats show a higher level of co-occurrence than expected
   from null models. That tendency in turn implies a higher variance in
   species richness among sites, generating a wider species-richness
   frequency distribution. The diversity field of individual species
   results from the size, shape and location of ranges, but also depends on
   the general pattern of richness for the whole family."
