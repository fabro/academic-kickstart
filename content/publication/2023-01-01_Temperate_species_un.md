abstract = "Understanding how temperature determines the distribution of life is
   necessary to assess species' sensitivities to contemporary climate
   change. Here, we test the importance of temperature in limiting the
   geographic ranges of ectotherms by comparing the temperatures and areas
   that species occupy to the temperatures and areas species could
   potentially occupy on the basis of their physiological thermal
   tolerances. We find that marine species across all latitudes and
   terrestrial species from the tropics occupy temperatures that closely
   match their thermal tolerances. However, terrestrial species from
   temperate and polar latitudes are absent from warm, thermally tolerable
   areas that they could potentially occupy beyond their equatorward range
   limits, indicating that extreme temperature is often not the factor
   limiting their distributions at lower latitudes. This matches
   predictions from the hypothesis that adaptation to cold environments
   that facilitates survival in temperate and polar regions is associated
   with a performance trade-off that reduces species' abilities to contend
   in the tropics, possibly due to biotic exclusion. Our findings predict
   more direct responses to climate warming of marine ranges and cool range
   edges of terrestrial species.
   The authors test whether a wide array of marine and terrestrial animal
   species occupy the full extent of their potential geographic range based
   on thermal tolerances. They find that many species are underfilling the
   warm part of their potential range, suggesting that biotic interactions
   can limit occupancy in climatically suitable areas adjacent to their
   ranges."
