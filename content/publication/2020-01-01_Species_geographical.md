abstract = "Understanding local coexistence and broad-scale species co-occurrence
   patterns are central questions in ecology and macroecology. Niche theory
   relates both spatial scales by considering the resources (Eltonian
   niche) and conditions (Grinnellian niche) used by species and allow us
   to assess the contribution of these factors for species co-occurrence.
   Indeed, combining local field data on diet preferences and climatic
   variables across species distributions can help us to evaluate their
   co-occurrence while jointly considering resources and conditions on
   niche partitioning. Here, using information drawn from literature, we
   evaluated the relationship between geographic, climatic (Grinnellian)
   and trophic (Eltonian) niche dimensions among five highly sympatric
   felid species in favoring species co-occurrence at broad spatial scales
   across the Neotropical region. We obtain potential geographic
   distributions of species through ecological niche models. Then, we
   calculated the pairwise species overlaps for each niche dimension and
   tested for a relationship between each pair of dimensions using Mantel
   and partial Mantel tests. We found a positive and significant
   relationship between geographic co-occurrence and climatic overlap. This
   relationship remained after controlling for trophic overlap. Geographic
   and trophic overlap, as well as climatic and trophic overlap, did not
   show significant relationships. We conclude that the high degree of
   geographic co-occurrence among our studied felid species is favored by
   climate and that their high degree of trophic overlap is not limiting
   their co-occurrence pattern."
