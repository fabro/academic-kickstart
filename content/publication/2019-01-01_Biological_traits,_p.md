abstract = "Aim Many hypotheses exist to explain the astonishing variation in
   geographical range size across species, but these have rarely been
   tested under a unifying framework that simultaneously considers direct
   and indirect effects of ecological niche processes and evolutionary
   dynamics. Here, we jointly evaluate ecological and evolutionary
   hypotheses that might account for global interspecific patterns of range
   size in the most species-rich avian order: Passeriformes (perching
   birds). Location Global. Time period Current. Major taxa studied Order
   Passeriformes. Methods We used phylogenetic path analysis to test for
   the relationship between eight variables and range size. Our list of
   predictors included a set of niche-related variables (both Grinellian
   and Eltonian), species-specific morphological and life-history traits
   (body size, dispersal ability and fertility), extrinsic (human
   footprint) and evolutionary factors (time since divergence from the
   closest extant relative). Results We found that Grinellian (climatic)
   and Eltonian (trophic) niche breadth are crucial to account for the
   observed patterns, followed by reproductive effort (as measured by
   clutch size). We also found a negative relationship between native range
   size and human footprint. The significant and positive relationship
   between niche breadth, either Grinnellian or Eltonian, and range size
   was consistent across all species, irrespective of their
   migratory/resident status or taxonomic grouping (Passeri versus
   Tyranni). Main conclusions Globally, the range sizes of passerine
   species are associated with the Grinellian niche, meaning that species
   with broader environmental tolerances exhibit larger geographical
   ranges. These findings give further empirical support to the positive
   niche breadth-range size relationship as a general pattern in ecology."
