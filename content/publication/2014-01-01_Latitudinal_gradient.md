abstract = "Several hypotheses have been advanced for the origin and diversification
   of the bat fauna of the New World. Traditional models considered one of
   the families (Vespertilionidae) to have had a North American origin,
   whilst the diversification of other seven families was thought to have
   occurred in South America. Present-day patterns of diversity are the
   result, according to these hypotheses, of the mixing of faunas, mostly
   coinciding with the Great American Biotic Interchange (GABI) of the
   Americas. Recent research has challenged the traditional model and has
   posited the possibility of dual centres of diversification (in South and
   North America) for families traditionally considered of strict South
   American origin. Here we examine the latitudinal patterns of bat
   diversity and endemism at the genus level and show that present-day
   patterns are more consistent with this dual-diversification hypothesis
   than with the traditional models. We document an asymmetrical
   latitudinal gradient of genus richness with a plateau near the equator,
   but with a decline in Central America and Mexico; however, in this area
   the relative number of genera, considering the species richness, is
   higher than expected by chance, as shown by a proper null model. The
   distribution and identity of endemic genera are consistent with models
   considering a North American origin for two of the families
   (Vespertilionidae and Natalidae), an early arrival to South America for
   another family (Molossidae), and a complex diversification process,
   involving two centres of diversification, for at least two of the
   families of the Noctilionoidea (Mormoopidae and Phyllostomidae) and
   possibly for the Emballonuridae. The recently identified Panamanian
   Realm (including southern Mexico and Central America) seems to have
   played a significant role in the diversification of New World bats."
