abstract = "AimMost biodiversity studies have considered species to be isolated
   entities, neglecting the fact that their biotic interactions and spatial
   variation are fundamental to their persistence across elevational
   gradients. Here, using a standardized sampling methodology, we evaluated
   how and why the composition of flower-visitor interactions (i.e. beta
   diversity) varies over an extensive elevational gradient. Specifically,
   we aimed to identify which biotic (species turnover) and abiotic factors
   (temperature, precipitation and primary productivity) inherent to
   elevational gradients can explain the distribution of floral
   visitor-plant interactions.LocationMexican Transition
   Zone.TaxonAngiosperms, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera and
   Coleoptera.MethodsWe sampled ecological interactions between floral
   visitors and flowering plants at 10 sites along an elevational gradient
   from 4 to 3425 m.a.s.l. We measured the additive partitioning of the
   beta diversity of species interactions and used generalized
   dissimilarity modelling to assess how spatial and environmental factors
   can explain the observed dissimilarity.ResultsWe found that the
   composition of interactions between floral visitors and plant species
   differs from lowlands to highlands mainly due to differences in
   temperature across the studied elevation gradient, rather than
   geographical distance or other environmental factors (i.e. mean annual
   precipitation and net primary productivity). We also observed that the
   main component of the beta diversity of interactions was interaction
   turnover driven by the turnover of both plants and floral visitors along
   the elevation gradient studied, which may be influenced by both
   temperature and the biogeographical affinity of biotas.Main
   ConclusionsWe conclude that environmental filters play a crucial role in
   the establishment of novel interactions, as temperature can filter
   species and impact the behaviour and traits of floral visitors and
   plants across an elevational gradient. These findings underscore the
   importance of considering the role of abiotic factors in predicting and
   explaining the distribution of species interactions across different
   elevational gradients."
