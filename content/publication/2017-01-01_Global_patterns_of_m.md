abstract = "AimTo analyse the geographical co-occurrence among mammal species based
   on their complete geographical distributions, considering their
   phylogenetic relationships and body size data. We describe species-level
   patterns and test the relative effects of ecological and evolutionary
   processes in determining species co-occurrence under the phylogenetic
   field framework.
   LocationGlobal.
   MethodsWe gathered distributional, phylogenetic and body size
   information for 3697 mammal species. We defined phylogenetic fields of
   species by estimating the phylogenetic structure of species
   co-occurrence within a focal species' range. Likewise, body size
   structure within focal species' ranges was defined as body size fields.
   We applied a spatial-phylogenetic statistical framework to evaluate
   geographical variation on species fields. Also, we tested the
   significance of phylogenetic and body size fields based on
   biogeographically informed null models. Analyses were done for all
   mammal species as a whole and within particular taxonomic orders.
   ResultsPhylogenetic and body size fields of mammal species showed
   significant geographical patterning beyond their spatial and
   phylogenetic dependence. Phylogenetic fields were strikingly different
   between the New and Old World, with mammals co-occurring with more
   closely related species in the New World and more distantly related
   species in the Old World. Clustered phylogenetic and body size fields
   showed geographically congruent patterns. Similar findings were obtained
   within particular mammalian orders.
   Main conclusionsGeographical co-occurrence among mammal species reveals
   the imprint of historical origins and dispersal of mammalian lineages.
   Phylogenetic and body size structure within mammalian ranges is driven
   by the distinct histories among biogeographical regions and mainly
   between the New and Old World. We demonstrate the usefulness of a new
   protocol integrating species' distributional, phylogenetic and body size
   information for linking evolutionary and ecological approaches to
   understand geographical patterns of biodiversity."
