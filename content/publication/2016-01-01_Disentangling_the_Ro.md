abstract = "Environmental gradients (EG) related to climate, topography and
   vegetation are among the most important drivers of broad scale patterns
   of species richness. However, these different EG do not necessarily
   drive species richness in similar ways, potentially presenting
   synergistic associations when driving species richness. Understanding
   the synergism among EG allows us to address key questions arising from
   the effects of global climate and land use changes on biodiversity.
   Herein, we use variation partitioning (also know as commonality
   analysis) to disentangle unique and shared contributions of different EG
   in explaining species richness of Neotropical vertebrates. We use three
   broad sets of predictors to represent the environmental variability in
   (i) climate (annual mean temperature, temperature annual range, annual
   precipitation and precipitation range), (ii) topography (mean elevation,
   range and coefficient of variation of elevation), and (iii) vegetation
   (land cover diversity, standard deviation and range of forest canopy
   height). The shared contribution between two types of EG is used to
   quantify synergistic processes operating among EG, offering new
   perspectives on the causal relationships driving species richness. To
   account for spatially structured processes, we use Spatial EigenVector
   Mapping models. We perform analyses across groups with distinct
   dispersal abilities (amphibians, non-volant mammals, bats and birds) and
   discuss the influence of vagility on the partitioning results. Our
   findings indicate that broad scale patterns of vertebrate richness are
   mainly affected by the synergism between climate and vegetation,
   followed by the unique contribution of climate. Climatic factors were
   relatively more important in explaining species richness of good
   dispersers. Most of the variation in vegetation that explains vertebrate
   richness is climatically structured, supporting the productivity
   hypothesis. Further, the weak synergism between topography and
   vegetation urges caution when using topographic complexity as a
   surrogate of habitat (vegetation) heterogeneity."
