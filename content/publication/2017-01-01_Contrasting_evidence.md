abstract = "AimPhylogenetic niche conservatism (PNC), a pattern of closely related
   species retaining ancestral niche-related traits over evolutionary time,
   is well documented for abiotic (Grinellian) dimensions of the ecological
   niche. However, it remains unclear whether biotic niche (Eltonian) axes
   are also phylogenetically conserved, even though knowledge of biotic
   niches is essential to an understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics
   of ecological communities. We conduct the first analysis of biotic PNC
   by evaluating dietary specialization in a vertebrate class.
   LocationGlobal.
   MethodsWe analysed two global compilations of diets of living mammals
   and a more detailed database for large carnivores together with a
   species-level phylogeny to evaluate trophic PNC. We searched for
   evidence of PNC by estimating the phylogenetic signal in distinct
   descriptors of dietary niche.
   ResultsTrophic niches were generally similar among related species but
   not strongly conserved under a niche-drift macroevolutionary model
   (Brownian motion). The degree of similarity in trophic niche varied
   among different taxonomic groups and was, importantly, even within the
   same group, contingent on the metric of dietary preferences used and the
   quality of information on the database.
   Main conclusionsOverall, our results showed limited support for PNC in
   the trophic niche of mammals. However, different data sources and
   metrics of dietary preferences sometimes offered different conclusions,
   highlighting the importance of gathering high-quality quantitative data
   and considering multiple metrics to describe dietary niche breadth and
   to assess PNC. The fully quantitative database for large carnivores
   provided some interesting evidence of PNC that could not be detected
   with semi-quantitative or presence/absence descriptors. Subsequent
   assessments of phylogenetic imprints on dietary specialization would
   benefit from considering different metrics and using well-resolved
   phylogenies jointly with detailed quantitative diet information. While
   Eltonian trophic niches did not show the same high levels of
   evolutionary conservatism often displayed by Grinnellian niches, both
   niche components should be considered to understand range limits of
   species and clades at biogeographic scales."
