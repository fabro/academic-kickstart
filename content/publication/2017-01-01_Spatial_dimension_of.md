abstract = "Background: Little is known about the existence or validity of
   ecogeographical rules - spatial patterns in biological traits - over
   geological time scales and in extinct clades. Some have claimed that
   pterosaurs, a Mesozoic clade of flying reptiles, follow Cope's rule -
   the trend of increasing body size through time - yet no conclusive
   explanations for this rule have been provided and some explanations even
   converge with those about Bergmann's rule: the tendency of species to be
   larger in colder environments.
   Goals: Determine whether Bergmann's rule exists in pterosaur reptiles
   over their evolutionary history, and discuss its potential association
   with Cope's rule.
   Data: Previously published morphological, phylogenetic, and geographic
   occurrence data of Pterosauria.
   Search methods: We applied cross-species and assemblage-based approaches
   along with phylogenetic comparative methods as well as sister-pair
   comparisons to evaluate the validity of Bergmann's rule in Pterosauria.
   Conclusions: Pterosaurian body size did not follow Bergmann's rule
   during the Triassic-Jurassic. But a converse Bergmann's rule may have
   been present during the Cretaceous. There is no strong evidence to
   support an influence of Bergmann's rule in the evolution of pterosaurian
   body size. Therefore, Cope's rule in Pterosauria seems to be a
   mechanistically independent macroevolutionary pattern."
