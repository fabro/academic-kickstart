abstract = "Knowledge about the dynamics of regional diversity patterns is a
   foundation on which measures aimed to protect diversity dimensions in
   the light of climate change can be constructed. Here, we describe
   taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity patterns of amphibians
   in the Yucatan Peninsula and their representation in the current
   protected area system. We stacked current and future potential
   distribution models to estimate taxonomic diversity and, based on the
   most recent amphibian phylogeny and nine functional traits, we measured
   phylogenetic and functional diversity. Independent phylogenetic and
   functional metrics were obtained by applying null models that allowed us
   to identify the presumably signature mechanisms underlying assemblage
   formation. We evaluated the effectiveness of the protected areas in
   protecting diversity dimensions across scenarios. We found phylogenetic
   and functional clustering as a result of environmental filters that have
   allowed only recently diverged species with converged functional traits
   to establish. Nevertheless, random assemblages are more widespread
   possibly due to the opposite directions in which competition and
   environmental filtering are acting. Overall, a decrease in all diversity
   dimensions is projected under future climate change scenarios compared
   with the current time. None of the protected areas evaluated were
   effective in protecting diversity dimensions, stressing the need to
   complete the existing protected areas network."
