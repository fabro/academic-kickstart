abstract = "Aim To explore whether environmental factors are correlated with genetic
   and morphometric differences in the widely distributed bat species
   Tadarida brasiliensis.
   Location North America and Central America.
   Methods We used an extensive sampling comprising 131 localities that
   represent heterogeneous environments across the Nearctic and Neotropical
   regions. Museum specimens were examined and 25 craniodental characters
   were recorded. Individuals were genotyped at one mitochondrial locus
   (mtDNA) and nine nuclear loci (nDNA). Clustering and phylogenetic
   analyses were used to identify differentiated groups. Environmental
   variables and PCA-env approaches were used to determine the climatic
   niche and to measure the niche overlap, equivalence and similarity
   between groups. Mantel tests between genetic groupings and environmental
   variables, dispersal costs, Euclidean geographical distances and niche
   overlap were performed.
   Results We identified six genetic groups within Central and North
   American T. brasiliensis based on nDNA. The most strongly differentiated
   group, in both nDNA and mtDNA, was located in central Mexico.
   Morphometric data showed that individuals from populations in Florida
   are slightly larger than the others. Niche overlap was detected among
   Neotropical groups but not among Nearctic groups. The currently
   recognized subspecies were not recovered as distinct groups with either
   genetic or morphometric data.
   Main conclusions Our approaches suggest that environmental niche
   variation may help shape the distribution of genetic variation across
   heterogeneous landscapes, particularly in widely distributed species.
   Environmental niche analyses suggest that genetic differences between
   migratory and non-migratory groups of T. brasiliensis may be promoted by
   climatic variation throughout the Nearctic and Neotropical regions. In
   addition, genetic and morphometric analyses do not support the current
   subspecies classification of T. brasiliensis in North and Central
   America, which should be abandoned."
