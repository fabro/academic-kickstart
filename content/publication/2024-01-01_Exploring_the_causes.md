abstract = "Species' range size is a fundamental unit of analysis in biodiversity
   research, given its association with extinction risk and species
   richness. One of its most notable patterns is its positive relationship
   with latitude, which has been considered an ecogeographical rule called
   Rapoport's rule. Despite this rule being confirmed for various taxonomic
   groups, its validity has been widely discussed and several taxa still
   lack a formal assessment. Different hypotheses have been proposed to
   explain their potential mechanisms, with those related to temperature
   and elevational being the most supported thus far. In this study, we
   employed two level of analyses (cross-species and assemblage) to
   investigate the validity of Rapoport's rule in spiny lizards (genus
   Sceloporus). Additionally, we evaluated four environmental-related
   hypotheses (minimum temperature, temperature variability, temperature
   stability since the last glacial maximum, and elevation) posed to
   explain such pattern, contrasting our results to those patterns expected
   under a null model of range position. Our results provided support for
   Rapoport's rule at both levels of analyses, contrasting with null
   expectations. Consistently, minimum temperature and elevation were the
   most relevant variables explaining the spatial variation in range size.
   At the cross-species level, our null simulations revealed that both
   variables deviated significantly from random expectations. Conversely,
   at the assemblage level, none of the variables were statistically
   different from the expected relationships. We discussed the implication
   of our findings in relation to the ecology and evolution of spiny
   lizards."
