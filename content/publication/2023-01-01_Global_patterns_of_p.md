abstract = "Questions: Geographic gradients of beta-diversity help understanding the
   relationship between species and their environment. However, on a global
   scale, such patterns are only known for a few taxa, mainly terrestrial
   vertebrates, especially when considering the phylogenetic dimension.
   Here, we present the first global analysis of phylogenetic
   beta-diversity (PBD) for angiosperms. We aim to disentangle the relative
   contribution of PBD components (turnover- and nestedness-resultant
   differences) and the deviation of PBD given the taxonomic beta-diversity
   (TBD) along environmental and geographic gradients.
   Location: Global.
   Methods: We compiled range maps of 207,146 angiosperm species at 1
   degrees cells and calculated PBD for assemblages formed by each focal
   cell and its neighboring cells in radii of 1.5 degrees and 2 degrees
   ({''}moving-window{''} approach). PBD was decomposed into turnover- and
   nestedness-resultant components, evaluating their relative importance as
   the proportion of nestedness-resultant PBD to the total PBD (PBDratio).
   To evaluate lineage exchanges, we calculated the deviation of PBD from
   TBD (PBDdev). We assessed the breakpoints of relationship between PBD
   and geographic (latitude and elevation) and environmental (temperature
   and precipitation) gradients using linear piecewise regressions.
   Results: The turnover-resultant component was predominant in shaping the
   global angiosperm PBD pattern. PBDratio was positively correlated with
   temperature, having a breakpoint around 14 degrees. Because PBDdev was
   mostly positive, TBD prevailed over PBD; PBDdev was correlated
   significantly with latitude and temperature gradients, being higher
   (i.e., low lineage replacement compared with species replacement) at
   latitudes above 50 degrees N, and in colder climates (below 2 degrees
   C).
   Conclusions: We provided the first global assessment of current
   geographic PBD patterns for angiosperms. Our results showed that such
   patterns are largely dictated by global environmental and geographic
   gradients, with lineage replacement being more important than lineage
   loss in virtually all areas, except at higher latitudes and on islands
   and peninsulas."
