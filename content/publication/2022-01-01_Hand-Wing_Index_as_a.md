abstract = "Measuring the dispersal ability of birds is particularly challenging and
   thus researchers have relied on the extended use of morphological
   proxies as surrogates for such ability. However, few studies have tested
   the relationship between morphological proxies and other
   dispersal-related traits. In this study, we test the relationship of the
   most commonly used morphological proxy for dispersal-the Hand-Wing Index
   (HWI)-with traits highly associated with dispersal abilities, such as
   geographic range size, migratory behaviour and migratory distances. We
   used the Emberizoidea superfamily to evaluate these relationships and
   measured the HWI of 2520 individuals from 431 species (almost half of
   all the species in the superfamily). We first estimated the phylogenetic
   signal of HWI and searched for the best evolutionary model to explain
   its variation. We then performed PGLS analyses to assess the
   relationships between HWI and dispersal abilities. Our results showed
   that HWI has a strong phylogenetic signal and is positively related to
   dispersal abilities. Our findings support the use of HWI as a viable
   morphological proxy for dispersal in birds."
