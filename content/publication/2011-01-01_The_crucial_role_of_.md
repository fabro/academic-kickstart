abstract = "Using known occurrences of species and correlational modeling approaches
   has become a common paradigm in broad-scale ecology and biogeography,
   yet important aspects of the methodology remain little-explored in terms
   of conceptual basis. Here, we explore the conceptual and empirical
   reasons behind choice of extent of study area in such analyses, and
   offer practical, but conceptually justified, reasoning for such
   decisions. We assert that the area that has been accessible to the
   species of interest over relevant time periods represents the ideal area
   for model development, testing, and comparison. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
