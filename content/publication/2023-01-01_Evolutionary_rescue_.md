abstract = "By the end of this century, human-induced climate change and habitat
   loss may drastically reduce biodiversity, with expected effects on many
   amphibian lineages. One of these effects is the shift in the geographic
   distributions of species when tracking suitable climates. Here, we
   employ a macroecological approach to dynamically model geographic range
   shifts by coupling ecological niche models and eco-evolutionary
   mechanisms, aiming to assess the probability of evolutionary rescue
   (i.e., rapid adaptation) and dispersal under climate change.
   Evolutionary models estimated the probability of population persistence
   by adapting to changes in the temperature influenced by precipitation in
   the following decades, while compensating the fitness reduction and
   maintaining viable populations in the new climates. In addition, we
   evaluated emerging patterns of species richness and turnover at the
   assemblage level. Our approach was able to identify which amphibian
   populations among 7,193 species at the global scale could adapt to
   temperature changes or disperse into suitable regions in the future.
   Without evolutionary adaptation and dispersal, 47.7\% of the species
   could go extinct until the year 2,100, whereas adding both processes
   will slightly decrease this extinction rate to 36.5\%. Although
   adaptation to climate is possible for populations in about 25.7\% of
   species, evolutionary rescue is the only possibility to avoid extinction
   in 4.2\% of them. Dispersal will allow geographic range shifts for
   49.7\% of species, but only 6.5\% may avoid extinction by reaching
   climatically suitable environments. This reconfiguration of species
   distributions and their persistence creates new assemblage-level
   patterns at the local scale. Temporal beta-diversity across the globe
   showed relatively low levels of species turnover, mainly due to the loss
   of species. Despite limitations with obtaining data, our approach
   provides more realistic assessments of species responses to ongoing
   climate changes. It shows that, although dispersal and evolutionary
   rescue may attenuate species losses, they are not enough to avoid a
   significant reduction of species' geographic ranges in the future.
   Actions that guarantee a higher potential of adaptation (e.g., genetic
   diversity through larger population sizes) and increased connectivity
   for species dispersion to track suitable climates become essential,
   increasing the resilience of biodiversity to climate change."
