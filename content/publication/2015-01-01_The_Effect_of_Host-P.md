abstract = "Understanding the drivers of plant-insect interactions is still a key
   issue in terrestrial ecology. Here, we used 30 well-defined
   plant-herbivore assemblages to assess the effects of host plant
   phylogenetic isolation and origin (native vs. exotic) on the species
   richness, composition and specialization of the insect herbivore fauna
   on co-occurring plant species. We also tested for differences in such
   effects between assemblages composed exclusively of exophagous and
   endophagous herbivores. We found a consistent negative effect of the
   phylogenetic isolation of host plants on the richness, similarity and
   specialization of their insect herbivore faunas. Notably, except for
   Jaccard dissimilarity, the effect of phylogenetic isolation on the
   insect herbivore faunas did not vary between native and exotic plants.
   Our findings show that the phylogenetic isolation of host plants is a
   key factor that influences the richness, composition and specialization
   of their local herbivore faunas, regardless of the host plant origin."
