abstract = "An understanding of patterns of climatic niche evolution has important
   implications for ecological and evolutionary theory and conservation
   planning. However, despite considerable testing, niche evolution studies
   continue to focus on clade-wide, homogeneous patterns, without
   considering the potentially complex dynamics (i.e. phylogenetic
   non-stationarity) along the evolutionary history of a clade. Here, we
   examine the dynamics of climatic niche evolution in vipers and discuss
   its implication for their current patterns of diversity and
   distribution. We use comparative phylogenetic methods and global-scale
   datasets, including 210 viper species with phylogenetic and climatic
   data. We find that climatic niche evolution in Viperidae shows an
   overall pattern of phylogenetic conservatism, but with different
   dynamics depending on the niche feature (niche breadth or niche
   position) and the evolutionary history of particular lineages within the
   family, thus resulting in phylogenetic non-stationarity. Indeed, we find
   several shifts in niche breadth evolution that were probably influenced
   by the main geological and environmental changes experienced during the
   evolutionary history of the family. These results highlight the
   importance of considering complex patterns of climatic niche evolution
   and their role in shaping patterns of diversity and distribution."
