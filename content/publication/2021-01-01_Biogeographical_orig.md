abstract = "Understanding the mechanisms of biological invasion is fundamental for
   biodiversity conservation in the Anthropocene. This study focused on a
   large-scale colonization pattern of exotic seed plants, which include
   1094 species characterized by different geographical origins, into the
   insular flora of Japan. We investigated a nation-wide pattern of species
   richness and phylogenetic structure (clustering/over-dispersion) of
   exotic and its recipient native species (4664 species). We tested the
   invasion hypotheses associated with environmental filtering, biological
   resistance of recipient assemblages, human disturbance and
   biogeographical origins of exotics. The exotics originated from the same
   (Palearctic and Indo-Malay) and adjacent (Nearctic and Oceanic)
   biogeographical regions were widely distributed across the country under
   temperate climate condition, whereas tropical exotic plants from remote
   regions (Afrotropic, Australasian, and Neotropical) colonized mainly the
   south-western parts of Japan. Exotic species richness and phylogenetic
   structure, especially those from the same/adjacent regions, were well
   explained by climatic, edaphic, and topographic factors, supporting the
   environmental filtering hypothesis. For all the biogeographical origins,
   exotic richness was positively associated with native richness, opposing
   the biological resistance hypothesis. Human disturbance was positively
   associated with exotic richness, while its relationships with the
   exotics' phylogenetic structure varied according to their
   biogeographical origins. These findings indicate that site's
   invasibility was determined by the combination of exotic's
   biogeographical origins and abiotic/biotic conditions of its recipient
   native flora. Our results suggest that global warming may accelerate the
   northward expansion of tropical exotic plants while future land-use
   changes can promote biological invasion regardless of exotics' origins."
