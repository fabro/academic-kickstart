abstract = "Understanding how species' ecological niches evolve can shed light on
   observed large-scale biogeographic patterns, temporal range shifts, and
   the potential ability for species to cope with climate changes. Here, we
   investigated climatic niche evolution in the Neotropical treefrog genus
   Pithecopus by testing for phylogenetic niche conservatism (PNC). We
   first evaluated niche overlap patterns based on pairwise niche
   comparisons of sister species pairs inferred from two alternative
   topologies for the genus, where higher niche overlap for those pairs
   compared to random species pairs would represent evidence of PNC.
   Second, we evaluated phylogenetic conservatism of climatic niches by
   fitting evolutionary models for niche position and niche breadth across
   the two alternative phylogenetic trees for the genus. Sister species
   pairs did not show higher mean niche overlap when compared to random
   pairs. Comparisons considering species' elevational habitats, on the
   other hand, showed that lowland sister species had greater niche overlap
   and montane species lower overlap than expected given the prevailing
   environmental conditions in each habitat, suggesting different
   evolutionary histories of niche differentiation for species with
   different elevational ranges. The best fit of niche position and breadth
   to both stasis and drift models supported the existence of PNC. We
   conclude that evolution of climatic niches in Pithecopus suggests
   overall PNC and that the contrasting patterns found for lowland and
   mountainous species reinforce the importance of considering the effects
   of habitat type in understanding climatic niches dynamics.
