abstract = "The adequacy of some promising phylogenetic comparative methods to test
   for trait-dependent diversification has been recently criticized to
   suffer from inflated Type 1 Error rates (i.e. model inadequacy).
   Nevertheless, formal tests of this model inadequacy for such models
   within an explicit geographical context are still missing as well as
   tests of other types of inadequacies such as those related to geographic
   and phylogenetic data (i.e. data inadequacies). Here, we take advantage
   of the striking geographic diversity gradient exhibited by bats to
   explicitly test whether inferences derived from the `geographic-state
   speciation-extinction' model (GeoSSE) are biased by model and data
   inadequacies. We used uncertainty, sensitivity and simulation analyses
   to show that GeoSSE is sensitive to data inadequacies, being more
   affected by geographical than phylogenetic inadequacies. Moreover, as
   previously suggested, the GeoSSE model suffers from inflated Type 1
   Error rates. Our results indicate that the GeoSSE model is not reliable
   for inferring the relative roles of evolutionary processes in driving
   the bat latitudinal diversity gradient. We argue that uncertainty,
   sensitivity and simulation analyses should be conducted in all
   comparative studies that associate species traits and diversification
   processes to understand diversity gradients."
