abstract = "Current claims of biodiversity crisis call for immediate conservation
   actions. These require the identification of priority sites for
   conservation based on an assessment of biodiversity patterns. Patterns
   of species richness are crucial in such endeavor. Also rarity, measured
   by the size of species' geographical ranges, is often used as a single
   or complementary criterion. For instance, hotspots for conservation have
   been defined using either one or the other criterion. We apply a novel
   tool, range-diversity plots, which simultaneously analyze species
   richness and range size from a presence-absence matrix to identify sites
   and species with potential conservation value. We applied this tool to
   the Mexican avifauna and show how it can be readily used to conduct
   broad-scale conservation assessments. Mexican birds showed congruent
   patterns between richness and rarity, richer sites harbor small-ranged
   species. Also, we identified Mexican ecoregions harboring
   richness-rarity sites and compared our assessment with an exhaustive
   prioritization procedure. A range-diversity approach can be useful when
   fine-scale information is lacking, such as in poorly studied regions. We
   demonstrate that spatial congruence between richness and rarity can be
   easily identified and interpreted using range-diversity plots based
   solely on a presence-absence matrix, providing a transparent, robust and
   explicit application for conservation assessments. (C) 2012 Elsevier
