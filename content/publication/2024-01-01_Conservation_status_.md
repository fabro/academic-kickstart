abstract = "The Neotropical realm hosts some of the Earth's most species-rich
   biodiversity hotspots, with vascular epiphytes significantly
   contributing to this diversity, regionally accounting for up to 39\% of
   the vascular flora. However, many regions of the Neotropics where
   epiphytic species of restricted distribution are reported coincide with
   threatened ecosystems, such as the tropical montane cloud forest.
   Moreover, epiphytes may be especially vulnerable to land use and climate
   change impacts due to their dependence on host trees. We assessed the
   conservation status of vascular epiphytes in the Neotropics for the
   families that represent over 80\% of the global epiphyte diversity
   (Araceae, Bromeliaceae, Orchidaceae, Piperaceae, and Polypodiaceae) and
   identified geographical centres of accumulation of threatened epiphyte
   species. We gathered information from free-access web repositories,
   specific epiphytic plant databases, and scientific and grey literature.
   We assessed the extinction risk of 11,446 epiphyte species following
   IUCN Red List guidelines, using Criterion B (geographic range size). We
   found nearly 60\% (6,721 species) to be threatened, with 1,766
   critically endangered (CR), 3,537 endangered (EN), and 1,418 vulnerable
   (VU). The threatened species are mainly found in the centres of endemism
   of vascular epiphytes in Central America, the northern Andes, and the
   Atlantic Forest. Our study emphasises that the centres of threatened
   species largely coincide with diversity hotspots, highlighting epiphytes
   as an especially vulnerable group that requires urgent conservation
   actions."
