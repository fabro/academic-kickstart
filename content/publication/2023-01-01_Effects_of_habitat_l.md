abstract = "Habitat loss has major impacts on biodiversity. Yet, such impacts are
   not always linear, as there can be threshold values of habitat amount
   below which species become extirpated from human-modified landscapes
   (extinction thresholds). This may be particularly the case for species
   with high habitat spatial requirements, especially in regions with a
   long land-use history, which have a lower extinction debt. To address
   these issues, we evaluated the linear and non-linear effects of
   landscape-scale forest (habitat) loss on primate species richness in
   regions with relatively new (Amazon) and old (Atlantic Forest) histories
   of land-use change. We also evaluated the role of mean home range size
   in regulating species responses to forest loss. Extinction thresholds
   were higher in the Atlantic Forest (78\% remaining forest cover) than in
   the Amazon (45\%), but primate-landscape associations were stronger in
   the Amazon. Thus, despite its recent land-use history, Amazon primates
   are more sensitive to habitat loss. As predicted, mean home range size
   decreased with forest loss in both biomes. Our findings highlight the
   importance of stopping deforestation in both biomes to maintain habitat
   amount above these thresholds. Yet, as <30\% of the Atlantic Forest
   cover remains today, promoting restoration initiatives across this biome
   is paramount.(c) 2023 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e
