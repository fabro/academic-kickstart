abstract = "Cerrado is considered one of the world's most threatened and
   floristically diverse tropical savannas. Distribution of the Cerrado
   flora comprises three countries: Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay;
   consequently, opportunities to conserve it require a transboundary
   effort. We aimed to (i) explore the relationship between a
   representative portion of Cerrado flora (8611 species), natural cover
   loss, and three country boundaries; and (ii) identify priority areas to
   expand protected areas at national and transboundary levels considering
   the different species conservation status, countries' governance, and
   natural cover loss. We modeled the distribution of Cerrado species for
   the three countries and overlapped species ranges with country
   boundaries to calculate species ranges shared between countries and the
   degree of endemicity. We identified national and transboundary priority
   regions to expand protected areas. We found that the areas with the
   highest plant richness are distributed in the central part of the
   Cerrado and Campos Rupestres Mountain Savanna ecoregions in Brazil
   (>8500 for the whole country). Bolivia ranked second in species richness
   (>4300), followed by Paraguay (>3700). The most anthropized areas in
   Brazil overlapped with regions predicted to foster the highest
   biodiversity. Conversely, such patterns were opposite in Bolivia and
   Paraguay, which harbored regions with high opportunities for Cerrado
   flora conservation. Transboundary prioritization suggested slightly
   higher species protection, including threatened and endemic species.
   Restoring some regions primarily in Brazil will be necessary to protect
   30 \% or 50 \% of the study area. Together, the three countries can
   support more comprehensive conservation actions for the great diversity
   of the Cerrado flora."
