abstract = "Trophic specialisation is known to vary across space, but the
   environmental factors explaining such variation remain elusive. Here we
   used a global dataset of flower-visitor networks to evaluate how trophic
   specialisation varies between latitudinal zones (tropical and temperate)
   and across elevation gradients, while considering the environmental
   variation inherent in these spatial gradients. Specifically, we assessed
   the role of current (i.e., net primary productivity, temperature, and
   precipitation) and historical (i.e., temperature and precipitation
   stability) environmental factors in structuring the trophic
   specialisation of floral visitors. Spatial variations in trophic
   specialisation were not explained by latitudinal zones or elevation.
   Moreover, regardless of network location on the spatial gradient, there
   was a tendency for higher trophic specialisation in sites with high
   productivity and precipitation, whereas historical temperature stability
   was related to lower trophic specialisation. We highlight that both
   energetic constraints in animal foraging imposed by climate and resource
   availability may drive the global variation in trophic specialisation."
