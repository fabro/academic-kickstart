abstract = "Aim Despite longstanding investigation, the gradients of species
   richness remain unknown for most taxa because of shortfalls in knowledge
   regarding the quantity and distribution of species. Here, we explore the
   ability of a geostatistical interpolation model, regression-kriging, to
   recover geographical gradients of species richness. We examined the
   technique with an in silico gradient of species richness and evaluated
   the effect of different configurations of knowledge shortfalls. We also
   took the same approach for empirical data with large knowledge gaps, the
   infraorder Furnariides of suboscine birds. Innovation Regression-kriging
   builds upon two cornerstones of geographical gradients of biodiversity,
   the spatial autocorrelation of species richness and the conspicuous
   association of species with environmental factors. With this technique,
   we recovered a simulated gradient of richness using < 0.01\% of sampling
   sites across the region. The accuracy of the regression-kriging is
   higher when input samples are more evenly distributed throughout the
   geographical space rather than the environmental space of the target
   region. Moreover, the accuracy of this method is more sensitive to the
   sufficiency of sampling effort within cells than to the quantity of
   sampled localities. For Furnariides birds, regression-kriging provided a
   geographical gradient of species richness that resembles purported
   patterns of other groups and illustrated ubiquitous shortfalls of
   knowledge about bird diversity. Main conclusions Geostatistical
   interpolation, such as regression-kriging, might be a useful tool to
   overcome shortfalls in knowledge that plague our understanding of
   geographical gradients of biodiversity, with many applications in
   ecology, palaeoecology and conservation."
