abstract = "Aim High levels of species richness in mountains are associated with
   their hypothetical roles as cradles and/or museums of diversity, but the
   generality of these roles remains unknown. To fill this gap, we tested
   these two hypotheses at a global scale and assessed the direct and
   indirect effects of abiotic regional features on the variation of
   montane amphibian richness world-wide.
   Location Global.
   Time period The last c. 300 Myr.
   Major taxa studied Amphibians.
   Methods Using an amphibian phylogeny containing 7,238 species, along
   with species distribution and climatic data, we estimated species
   richness, speciation rates, evolutionary time, terrain roughness, area
   and climatic stability for 514 mountain ranges. We evaluated the direct
   and indirect effects of these variables on richness patterns across
   these mountains using structural equation models.
   Results We found that most diverse mountain ranges for amphibians are
   concentrated in the Neotropics, but the fastest speciation rates are not
   restricted to this region. Instead, we found that evolutionary time,
   area and climatic stability better explained the global patterns of
   amphibian diversity in mountains. Species richness is higher in mountain
   regions with large and climatically stable areas, where early-derived
   lineages originated/established and accumulated through time.
   Main conclusions Mountains host an invaluable biodiversity shaped
   through deep time. Differences in speciation rates do not play a major
   role in explaining amphibian species richness across mountains. Instead,
   mountains experiencing milder historical climatic oscillations and
   having greater available areas for species persistence are likely to
   have faced lower extinction rates, leading to an increased accumulation
   of amphibian species through time. This condition highlights the
   importance of mountains as museums of deep evolutionary legacies and
   species-rich biotas."
