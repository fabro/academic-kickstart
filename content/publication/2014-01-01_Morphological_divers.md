abstract = "The morphology of species can be used to represent their ecological
   position and infer potential processes determining the structure of
   species assemblages. This ecomorphological approach has been widely
   applied to the study of bat assemblages which mainly focuses on a single
   spatial scale and particular guilds. We extended such an
   ecomorphological approach to a multi-scale analysis of a Neotropical bat
   assemblage and its constituent guilds (aerial and gleaning insectivores,
   frugivores, and nectarivores) to describe their structure at different
   spatial scales and determine the relative importance of inter-specific
   competition, habitat filtering, or stochastic processes shaping such
   structures. We measured the occupied morphological space (size) defined
   by wing and skull morphology independently and the nearest-neighbour
   distance (structure) among species within these spaces at each spatial
   scale. Observed patterns were compared with random expectations derived
   from null models for statistical inference. When controlling for species
   richness and regional sampling effects in the null models, we did not
   find a significant effect of spatial scale in the morphological
   structure of the studied bat assemblage and guilds. Morphological
   structure followed the same patterns across scales as those expected
   from random drawings of sample size alone. Similar results were obtained
   regardless of morphological complex (wing and skull) and guilds. At both
   the assemblage and guild levels, bat morphological structure seems to be
   determined by regional, abiotic processes (e.g. habitat filtering)
   shaping the composition and organization of the species pool."
