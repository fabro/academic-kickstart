abstract = "Body size is one of the most influential traits affecting many ecological and physiological processes across animal and plant taxa. Studies of the environmental factors shaping body size patterns may evaluate either temporal or spatial dimensions. Here, we analyzed body size evolution in the radiation of Anolis lizards across both geographical and temporal dimensions. We used a set of macroecological and macroevolutionary methods to test current and past environmental effects on geographical gradients of body size and its evolutionary rates. First, we test whether a set of current ecological/physiological hypotheses (heat balance, productivity and seasonality) explains spatial body size gradients. Second, we evaluate how tempo (i.e. evolutionary rates) and mode (i.e. evolutionary process) of body size evolution changed through time and the role of paleo-temperatures on rates of body size evolution during the Cenozoic. We did not find a signature of current environmental variables driving spatial body size gradients. By contrast, we found strong support for a correlation between temperature changes (i.e. climate cooling) during the Cenozoic and rates of body size evolution (i.e. body size diversification). We suggest that patterns of body size evolution in Anolis lizards might be influenced by thermoregulatory behavior across clades and regions."
