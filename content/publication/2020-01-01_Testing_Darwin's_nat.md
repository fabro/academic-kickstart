abstract = "Charles Darwin posited two alternative hypotheses to explain the success
   of nonnative species based on their relatedness to natives: nonnative
   species that are closely related to native species could experience (1)
   higher invasion success because of an increased probability of habitat
   suitability (conferred by trait similarity) or (2) lower invasion
   success due to biotic interference, such as competition and limiting
   similarity. The paradox raised by the opposing predictions of these two
   hypotheses has been termed ``Darwin's naturalization conundrum{''}
   (DNC). Using plant communities measured repeatedly across an
   experimental fire gradient in an oak savanna (Minnesota, USA) over 31
   yr, we evaluated the DNC by incorporating taxonomic, functional, and
   phylogenetic information. We used a ``focal-species{''} approach, in
   which the taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic structure of species
   co-occurring with a given nonnative (focal) species in local communities
   was quantified. We found three main results: first, nonnative species
   tended to co-occur most with closely related natives, except at the
   extreme ends of the fire gradient (i.e., in communities with no fire and
   those subjected to high fire frequencies); second, with increasing fire
   frequency, nonnative species were functionally more similar to native
   species in recipient communities; third, functional similarity between
   co-occurring nonnatives and natives was stable over time, but their
   phylogenetic similarity was not, suggesting that dynamic external forces
   (e.g., climate variability) influenced the phylogenetic relatedness of
   nonnatives to natives. Our results provide insights for understanding
   invasion dynamics across environmental gradients and highlight the
   importance of evaluating different dimensions of biodiversity in order
   to draw stronger inferences regarding species co-occurrence at different
   spatial and temporal scales."
