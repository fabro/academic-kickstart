abstract = "Mexico is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world, with an
   important proportion of endemism mainly because of the convergence of
   the Nearctic and Neotropical biogeographic regions, which generate great
   diversity and species turnover at different spatial scales. However,
   most of our knowledge of the Mexican ant biota is limited to a few
   well-studied taxa, and we lack a comprehensive synthesis of ant
   biodiversity information. For instance, most of the knowledge available
   in the literature on Mexican ant fauna refers only to species lists by
   states, or is focused on only a few regions of the country, which
   prevents the study of several basic and applied aspects of ants, from
   diversity and distribution to conservation. Our aims in this data paper
   are therefore (1) to compile all the information available regarding
   ants across the Mexican territory, and (2) to identify major patterns in
   the gathered data set and geographic gaps in order to direct future
   sampling efforts. All records were obtained from raw data, including
   both unpublished and published information. After exhaustive filtering
   and updating information and synonyms, we compiled a total of 21,731
   records for 887 ant species distributed throughout Mexico from 1894 to
   2018. These records were concentrated mainly in the states of Chiapas (n
   = 6,902, 32.76\%) and Veracruz de Ignacio de la Llave (n = 4,329,
   19.92\%), which together comprise half the records. The subfamily with
   the highest number of records was Myrmicinae (n = 10,458 records,
   48.12\%), followed by Formicinae (n = 3,284, 15.11\%) and Ponerinae (n =
   1,914, 8.8\%). Most ant records were collected in the Neotropical region
   of the country (n = 12,646, 58.19\%), followed by the Mexican transition
   zone (n = 5,237, 24.09\%) and the Nearctic region (n = 3,848, 17.72\%).
   Native species comprised 95.46\% of the records (n = 20,745). To the
   best of our knowledge, this is the most complete data set available to
   date in the literature for the country. We hope that this compilation
   will encourage researchers to explore different aspects of the
   population and community research of ants at different spatial scales,
   and to aid in the establishment of conservation policies and actions.
