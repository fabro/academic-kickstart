abstract = "AimEndemic species, characterised by limited geographic ranges, face a
   high risk of extinction. The neotropical region harbours diverse
   ecosystems and a substantial number of endemic species, thus identifying
   areas of high endemism is crucial for protecting unique and threatened
   species and ecosystems. Vascular epiphytes-nonparasitic plants that grow
   on other plants without contact with the soil-exhibit remarkable
   diversity in the neotropics, with 63\% of the global total of ca. 31,000
   epiphyte species found in this region. This study aims to describe the
   endemism centres for the five most species-rich families of vascular
   epiphytes.LocationNeotropics.TaxonTracheophyta.MethodsWe gathered
   information from free-access web repositories, specific epiphytic plant
   databases and scientific and grey literature on epiphyte species of the
   families Araceae, Bromeliaceae, Orchidaceae, Piperaceae and
   Polypodiaceae within the neotropical realm as defined by Morrone et al.
   (2022). Geographical ranges were calculated using minimum convex
   polygons for 11,446 species, accounting for about 70\% of all epiphyte
   species in the neotropics. Narrow endemic species were defined as those
   within the first quartile of the density distribution of geographic
   range sizes within each family and we identified endemism centres for
   epiphyte species of the five families.ResultsOur study identified
   endemism centres for vascular epiphyte species in several biogeographic
   provinces, including Paramo, Cauca, Guatuso-Talamanca, Atlantic, Yungas
   and Puntarenas-Chiriqui. Orchidaceae, accounting for most of the
   analysed species (71\%), drove the overall distribution pattern;
   however, endemism patterns varied among families.Main ConclusionsRegions
   with high epiphyte richness exhibited a greater proportion of endemic
   species, though the composition of epiphyte species varied considerably
   among regions. The endemism centres identified in this study could be
   prioritised as conserved and protected areas."
