abstract = "The honeybee (Apis mellifera) is one of the most important pollinator
   species because it can gather resources from a vast variety of plant
   species, including both natives and introduced, across its geographical
   distribution. Although A. mellifera interacts with a large diversity of
   plants and shares resources with other pollinators, there are some plant
   species with which it interacts more frequently than others. Here, we
   evaluated the plant traits (i.e., plant length, abundance of bloomed
   individuals, number of open flowers, and stamen length) that would
   affect the honeybee visit frequencies to the flowers in a coastal
   environment in the Gulf of Mexico. Moreover, we evaluated which native
   bee species (and their body size) overlap floral resource with A.
   mellifera. We registered 998 plant-bee interactions between 35 plant
   species and 47 bee species. We observed that plant species with low
   height and with high abundances of bloomed individuals are positively
   related to a high frequency of visits by A. mellifera. Moreover, we
   found that A. mellifera tends to share a higher number of plant species
   with other bee species with a similar or smaller body size than with
   bigger species, which makes them a competitor for the resource with
   honeybees. Our results highlight that the impacts of A. mellifera on
   plants and native bees could be anticipated based on its individual's
   characteristics (i.e., plant height and abundance of bloomed
   individuals) and body size, respectively."
