abstract = "Despite the long-standing interest in the organization of ant
   communities across elevational gradients, few studies have incorporated
   the evolutionary information to understand the historical processes that
   underlay such patterns. Through the evaluation of phylogenetic alpha and
   beta-diversity, we analyzed the structure of leaf-litter ant communities
   along the Cofre de Perote mountain in Mexico and evaluated whether
   deterministic- (i.e., habitat filtering, interspecific competition) or
   stochastic-driven processes (i.e., dispersal limitation) were driving
   the observed patterns. Lowland and some highland sites showed
   phylogenetic clustering, whereas intermediate elevations and the highest
   site presented phylogenetic overdispersion. We infer that strong
   environmental constraints found at the bottom and the top elevations are
   favoring closely-related species to prevail at those elevations.
   Conversely, less stressful climatic conditions at intermediate
   elevations suggest interspecific interactions are more important in
   these environments. Total phylogenetic dissimilarity was driven by the
   turnover component, indicating that the turnover of ant species along
   the mountain is actually shifts of lineages adapted to particular
   locations resembling their ancestral niche. The greater phylogenetic
   dissimilarity between communities was related to greater temperature
   differences probably due to narrow thermal tolerances inherent to
   several ant lineages that evolved in more stable conditions. Our results
   suggest that the interplay between environmental filtering,
   interspecific competition and habitat specialization plays an important
   role in the assembly of leaf-litter ant communities along elevational
   gradients."
