abstract = "Studies at local spatial scales have shown that the generalist honeybee
   Apis mellifera L. can strongly affect the structural organization and
   properties of pollination networks. However, there is still little
   knowledge on how the connectivity of the honeybee within networks (i.e.,
   interactive role) could affect pollination networks at a global scale.
   To fill this gap, we evaluated how the interactive role of A. mellifera
   could affect niche overlap, specialization, and robustness of
   pollination networks. We used 109 weighted pollination networks spread
   across about 94 degrees of latitude and 227 degrees of longitude. We
   developed a new standardized framework based on species removal to
   assess the impact of the honeybee on plant-pollinator networks. We found
   that when the honeybee was removed from the networks, plant species had
   less niche overlap (i.e., shared fewer interactions via their
   pollinators) and the networks became more specialized and more robust to
   species extinctions. Our findings indicate that A. mellifera's effects
   on pollination networks vary geographically and could influence several
   ecological and evolutionary factors acting at local scales, including
   pollination services. We hope this contribution will stimulate new
   macroecological studies involving abundant and generalist species and
   their functional roles within ecological communities."
