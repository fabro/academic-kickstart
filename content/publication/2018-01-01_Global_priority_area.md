abstract = "Aim Lack of biological information is a silent but strong impediment for
   planning how to rescue amphibians from extinction. Currently, 24\% of
   all amphibian species are assigned to the Data Deficient (DD) category
   of IUCN. Here, we aim to identify priority areas for amphibian research
   that could help gather information on these species and overcome such
   knowledge gap. Location Taxon Global. Amphibians. Methods Results We
   mapped the distribution of 1578 DD amphibian species and then defined
   priority research areas as those areas with high and complementary
   concentration of amphibian DD species that could be considered important
   areas for studying (and therefore conserving) such species. To evaluate
   the performance of the proposed priority research areas, we calculated
   the percentage of species overlapping these areas, considering all
   amphibian DD species; recently described species and geographically
   restricted DD species. We also determined the proportion of priority
   research areas falling inside each continent and country of the world.
   Finally, we estimated the level protection of these species and of human
   pressure on natural ecosystems found within our priority research areas.
   We showed that gathering biological information of species from just
   0.4\% of the world area could clarify the conservation status of more
   than 80\% of DD amphibians. Most identified priority research areas
   overlap with regions under high human pressure and only a small
   percentage of DD amphibian species might cope with those altered
   conditions. Main conclusions Knowledge shortfalls represent a major
   issue for amphibian conservation globally, however, the picture could
   radically change if research efforts and investments are geographically
   strategically distributed. This study brings the first application of a
   complementary-based tool, which has been originally designed and
   implemented in conservation planning, aimed at generating information
   that help researchers to fill knowledge gaps as efficiently as possible."
