abstract = "Empirical evidence has shown that introduced honeybees, Apis mellifera
   L., can change the structural organization of eco-logical networks
   involving pollinators and flowering plants. In this case, studies have
   shown that A. mellifera is highly connected within networks (i.e., high
   interactive role) mainly due to its high abundances, long colony
   lifetime, generalist diet, and great capacity of spread and adaptation
   to new environments. However, there is little knowledge on how the
   interactive role of A. mellifera in these flower-visitor networks
   changes spatially and the potential correlates of such variation across
   ecological and geographical gradients worldwide. In this study, we
   evaluated how native and exotic distribution ranges, local climate,
   human influence (i.e., anthropogenic disturbance), and latitude shape
   the interactive role of the honeybee in plant -floral visitor networks
   globally. To achieve that, we compiled 95 weighted plant -floral visitor
   networks encompassing ca. 87 degrees of latitude and 227 degrees of
   longitude across the globe. We found that the interactive role of A.
   mellifera is higher in its exotic range than in the native
   distributional range and positively associated with mean annual
   temperature and precipitation. Further, the interactive role of A.
   mellifera was high at intermediate values of global human influence and
   increased with latitude. Our findings help us to understand how
   different drivers related to rapid global change could affect the
   capacity of A. mellifera to colonize and increase its impact on other
   pollinator species in different environments. (C) 2022 The Author(s).
