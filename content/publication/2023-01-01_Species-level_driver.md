abstract = "Bird-plant seed-dispersal networks are structural components of
   ecosystems. The role of bird species in seed-dispersal networks (from
   less {[}peripheral] to more connected {[}central]), determines the
   interaction patterns and their ecosystem services. These roles may be
   driven by morphological and functional traits as well as evolutionary,
   geographical and environmental properties acting at different spatial
   extents. It is still unknown if such drivers are equally important in
   determining species centrality at different network levels, from
   individual local networks to the global meta-network representing
   interactions across all local networks. Using 308 networks covering five
   continents and 11 biogeographical regions, we show that at the global
   meta-network level species' range size was the most important driver of
   species centrality, with more central species having larger range sizes,
   which would facilitate the interaction with a higher number of plants
   and thus the maintenance of seed-dispersal interactions. At the local
   network level, body mass was the only driver with a significant effect,
   implying that local factors related to resource availability are more
   important at this level of network organisation than those related to
   broad spatial factors such as range sizes. This could also be related to
   the mismatch between species-level traits, which do not consider
   intraspecific variation, and the local networks that can depend on such
   variation. Taken together, our results show that the drivers determining
   species centrality are relative to the levels of network organisation,
   suggesting that prediction of species functional roles in seed-dispersal
   interactions requires combined local and global approaches."
