abstract = "Aim Exceptions to the quasi-ubiquitous latitudinal diversity gradient
   (LDG) have been poorly studied. A reverse LDG, when species richness
   (SR) increases away from the Equator, has been suggested for several
   taxa and entire biomes. The Neotropical seasonally dry tropical forests
   (SDTF) are a well-known example of a reverse LDG that could be caused by
   the climatic stability of Pleistocene Refugia and dispersion from
   distinct source areas. Here, we test these predictions under a spatial
   and phylogenetic framework. Location Neotropics. Taxon Woody plants.
   Methods We used a recent species-level seed plant phylogeny and the
   DRYFLOR dataset to evaluate the geographic patterns of phylogenetic
   diversity (PD) and structure of woody plant assemblages associated with
   the Neotropical SDTFs. We conducted spatial regressions to test the
   effect of climatic instability since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) on
   assemblages' residual PD (controlling for SR) and null model analysis to
   evaluate their phylogenetic structure using the Net Relatedness Index.
   Results Phylogenetic diversity of the Neotropical SDTFs increased away
   from the Equator, likely driven by SR. This pattern was not related to
   climatic instability since the LGM. Phylogenetic structure of SDTF
   assemblages showed considerable spatial patterning, with significant
   phylogenetic clustering in the Mesoamerica and Caatinga regions. Main
   conclusion The reverse latitudinal SR gradient of the Neotropical SDTF
   assemblages is mirrored by their PD. Phylogenetic history seems to have
   influenced such patterns differently across the Neotropics with no
   relationship to climatic stability since the LGM, where particular SDTF
   nuclei previously suggested as Pleistocene refugia served as cradles and
   source areas for the current diversity pattern of the biome."
