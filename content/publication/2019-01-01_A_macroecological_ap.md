abstract = "Despite the widespread use of ecological niche models (ENMs) for
   predicting the responses of species to climate change, these models do
   not explicitly incorporate any population-level mechanism. On the other
   hand, mechanistic models adding population processes (e.g. biotic
   interactions, dispersal and adaptive potential to abiotic conditions)
   are much more complex and difficult to parameterize, especially if the
   goal is to predict range shifts for many species simultaneously. In
   particular, the adaptive potential (based on genetic adaptations,
   phenotypic plasticity and behavioral adjustments for physiological
   responses) of local populations has been a less studied mechanism
   affecting species' responses to climatic change so far. Here, we discuss
   and apply an alternative macroecological framework to evaluate the
   potential role of evolutionary rescue under climate change based on
   ENMs. We begin by reviewing eco-evolutionary models that evaluate the
   maximum sustainable evolutionary rate under a scenario of environmental
   change, showing how they can be used to understand the impact of
   temperature change on a Neotropical anuran species, the Schneider's toad
   Rhinella diptycha. Then we show how to evaluate spatial patterns of
   species' geographic range shift using such models, by estimating
   evolutionary rates at the trailing edge of species distribution
   estimated by ENMs and by recalculating the relative amount of total
   range loss under climate change. We show how different models can reduce
   the expected range loss predicted for the studied species by potential
   ecophysiological adaptations in some regions of the trailing edge
   predicted by ENMs. For general applications, we believe that parameters
   for large numbers of species and populations can be obtained from
   macroecological generalizations (e.g. allometric equations and
   ecogeographical rules), so our framework coupling ENMs with
   eco-evolutionary models can be applied to achieve a more accurate
   picture of potential impacts from climate change and other threats to
   biodiversity."
