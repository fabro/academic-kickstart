abstract = "Explaining the causes of geographic gradients in biodiversity remains an
   elusive task. Traditionally, correlative approaches have been used to
   relate species richness with contemporary climate, without actually
   explaining the causal factors. Recent approaches propose simulation
   models as more appropriate tools for assessing potential causes of
   macroecological patterns. Here we developed stochastic models to assess
   the relative contribution of climate and niche conservatism in
   determining compositional similarity among sites (co-diversity) and
   geographic association among species (co-distribution) in the bat family
   Phyllostomidae. We used range-diversity plots and variance-ratio tests
   to describe and evaluate such patterns. Our results supported a strong
   effect of climate in determining cohesive ranges causing positive
   co-diversity and co-distribution. We also demonstrated a marginal effect
   of niche conservatism, as modeled here, among species in shaping these
   patterns. However, climate and niche conservatism are not sufficient and
   other processes are still required to explain observed patterns. Our
   study highlights the importance of historical processes and demonstrates
   the usefulness of a simulation framework in testing biogeographical
   hypothesis to understand the relationship between diversity and
   distribution."
