abstract = "Tropical montane cloud forest harbors great species diversity in a small
   area of the planet and has a high proportion of endemics. At the local
   scale, species richness is low, but species turnover is high. We
   examined how amphibian species richness and the number of endemic
   species varies in cloud forests along a latitudinal gradient (23 degrees
   N-5 degrees S) in the Neotropics, where the latitudinal distribution of
   cloud forest is the most widespread compared with all of the other
   tropical regions. We also compared diversity patterns between anurans,
   caudates and gymnophionids, and tested their relationship to climate
   variables. Based on an analysis of 1005 species, we found that amphibian
   species richness increased towards the equator, but the increase was not
   linear. In Middle America there is a notable fluctuation in the number
   of species. The greatest species richness occurred between 6 degrees N
   and 7 degrees N, and there was an abrupt change between this region and
   Middle America. Analyses at the level of order and the endemic species
   level revealed two opposite patterns: anuran, gymnophionid and endemic
   species richness increased towards lower latitudes, while salamander
   species richness increased towards northern latitudes. Climate variables
   explained less than half of the variations in total species richness,
   suggesting that factors other than climate such as the historical
   biogeography of each taxon, orographic heterogeneity and the natural
   history traits of each group may be playing relevant roles in the
   patterns observed."
