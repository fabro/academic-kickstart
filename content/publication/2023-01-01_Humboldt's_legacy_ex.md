abstract = "The scientific work of Alexander von Humboldt was influenced by his
   interaction with the diversity and natural wealth of the Neotropics.
   Here, we evaluated several hypotheses in explaining plant diversity
   along an elevational gradient that Humboldt himself visited during his
   journey across Mexico. We analysed the species diversity of flowering
   plants at eight sites between 30 to 3500 m a.s.l. We found that
   temperature was the main predictor of the diversity of the studied
   plants. Given the current global environmental crisis, an integrative
   vision based on Humboldt's method is necessary.
   The scientific work of Alexander von Humboldt was influenced by his
   interaction with the diversity and natural wealth of the Neotropics. He
   proposed that climate determines plant diversity along elevational
   gradients based on his observations. Here, we evaluated the most
   prominent climate-based hypotheses in explaining plant diversity along
   an elevational gradient that Humboldt himself visited during his journey
   across Mexico. Specifically, we examined how climatic variables and
   forest-use intensity affected species richness and phylogenetic
   structure of major angiosperm life forms (trees, shrubs, epiphytes,
   herbs and lianas) along the Cofre de Perote mountain, Veracruz, Mexico.
   We analysed species richness and phylogenetic structure of angiosperms
   at eight sites between 30 to 3500 m a.s.l. We estimated the phylogenetic
   structure using a mega-phylogeny of angiosperms and the
   abundance-weighted net relatedness index. We considered multiple
   environmental factors' direct and indirect effects by applying a
   piecewise structural equation modelling approach. Each life form
   responds differently to the environmental variables included in our
   model; however, it is observed that temperature is the main predictor of
   the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of the angiosperms studied,
   both when the different life forms are grouped and separated. Potential
   evapotranspiration and precipitation are variables that also influence
   some life forms' diversity, especially taxonomic diversity. The
   forest-use intensity negatively affected only the taxonomic diversity of
   trees. These results highlight the influence of studying the different
   life forms of angiosperms in diversity gradient models and show the
   great influence that temperature has in conjunction with other
   environmental variables to promote the taxonomic and phylogenetic
   diversity of plant communities. Given the current global environmental
   crisis, an integrative biogeographically oriented vision based on
   Humboldt's method is necessary. Honouring the work of Humboldt and
   continuing his legacy demands more research to understand the causes
   behind elevational diversity gradients."
