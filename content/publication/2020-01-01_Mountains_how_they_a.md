abstract = "Mountains cover 12\% of the earth's surface and 23\% of the Mexican
   territory. Our goal with this essay is to provide the readers with a
   current and objective definition of what a mountain is, as well as to
   inform them in a simple way about the biological importance of mountains
   as guardians of biodiversity and providers of ecosystem services. To do
   so, we performed a literature search of the most important works on
   mountain ecology. Our main result is to recognize mountains as priority
   conservation sites due to the multiple benefits they provide to
   humanity. Unfortunately, many of the mountains in the world and in
   Mexico are under different threats."
