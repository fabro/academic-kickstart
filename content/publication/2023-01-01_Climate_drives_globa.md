abstract = "The authors incorporate mechanistic information about lizard
   physiological responses to heat into predictions of trait variation
   across time and space, finding that the range of functional traits is
   more constrained in locations where the local climate strongly selects
   for thermal performance.
   A major challenge in ecology and evolution is to disentangle the
   mechanisms driving broad-scale variation in biological traits such as
   body size, colour, thermal physiology traits and behaviour. Climate has
   long been thought to drive trait evolution and abiotic filtering of
   trait variation in ectotherms because their thermal performance and
   fitness are closely related to environmental conditions. However,
   previous studies investigating climatic variables associated with trait
   variation have lacked a mechanistic description of the underpinning
   processes. Here, we use a mechanistic model to predict how climate
   affects thermal performance of ectotherms and thereby the direction and
   strength of the effect of selection on different functional traits. We
   show that climate drives macro-evolutionary patterns in body size, cold
   tolerance and preferred body temperatures among lizards, and that trait
   variation is more constrained in regions where selection is predicted to
   be stronger. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for
   observations on how climate drives trait variation in ectotherms through
   its effect on thermal performance. By connecting physical, physiological
   and macro-evolutionary principles, the model and results provide an
   integrative, mechanistic framework for predicting organismal responses
   to present climates and climate change."
