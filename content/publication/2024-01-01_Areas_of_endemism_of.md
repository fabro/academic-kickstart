   remain little studied despite the fact that identifying the patterns of
   functional signatures in areas of endemism could reveal important
   information regarding community assembly and functioning. Here, we
   investigated whether areas of endemism of the orchids of Megamexico are
   hotspots of biotic interactions by comparing the orchid-pollinator
   interactions with those of adjacent areas. Patterns of functional
   signatures and phylogenetic signal were estimated, using pollination
   syndromes as a proxy for functional attributes. Phylogenetic signal was
   estimated by coding pollinator groups for every orchid recorded. Metrics
   of the interaction networks and the phylogenetic signal were compared
   with those obtained from adjacent areas. Our results indicate that areas
   of endemism show higher significant differences in the phylogenetic
   signal compared with adjacent areas. This can be explained by the many
   distantly related orchid lineages sharing attributes related to
   pollination. Network size and robustness differed statistically between
   the areas of endemism and the adjacent areas. The same configuration of
   modules in interaction networks was found in the areas of endemism;
   however, remarkably, the composition of species in large genera differed
   in these areas. Areas of endemism harbor more orchid lineages that
   closely interact with many groups of insects. The southerly areas of
   endemism in Chiapas and Central America are prominent, with the most
   significant phylogenetic signal and networks metrics. Results indicate
   that areas of endemism for the orchids of Megamexico represent hotspots
   of biotic interactions. Strategies for conservation must take this
   biotic interaction into account.
   To investigate whether areas of endemism of the orchids of Megamexico
   are hotspots of orchid-pollinator interactions, phylogenetic signal and
   interaction networks were determined and compared with adjacent areas.
   Size and robustness differed statistically between the areas of endemism
   and the adjacent areas, and phylogenetic signal was higher in areas of
   endemism. The most remarkable areas with the highest estimations were
   located southerly, in Chiapas, Mexico, and the north of Central America.
