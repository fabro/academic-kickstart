abstract = "Traditionally, most studies have described the organization of host-parasite interaction networks by considering only few host groups at limited geographical extents. However, host-parasite relationships are merged within different taxonomic groups and factors shaping these interactions likely differ between host and parasite groups, making group-level differences important to better understand the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of these interactive communities. Here we used a dataset of 629 ectoparasite species and 251 species of terrestrial mammals, comprising 10 orders distributed across the Nearctic and Neotropical regions of Mexico to assess the species-level drivers of mammalian ectoparasite faunas. Specifically, we evaluated whether body weight, geographical range size and within-range mammal species richness (i.e. diversity field) predict mammal ectoparasite species richness (i.e. degree centrality) and their closeness centrality within the mammal-ectoparasite network. In addition, we also tested if the observed patterns differ among mammal orders and if taxonomic closely related host mammals could more likely share the same set of ectoparasites. We found that ectoparasite species richness of small mammals (mainly rodents) with large proportional range sizes was high compared to large-bodied mammals, whereas the diversity field of mammals had no predictive value (except for bats). We also observed that taxonomic proximity was a main determinant of the probability to share ectoparasite species. Specifically, the probability to share ectoparasites in congeneric species reached up to 90\\% and decreased exponentially as the taxonomic distance increased. Further, we also detected that some ectoparasites are generalists and capable to infect mammalian species across different orders and that rodents have a remarkable role in the network structure, being closely connected to many other taxa. Hence, because many rodent species have synanthropic habits they could act as undesired reservoirs of disease agents for humans and urban animals. Considering the reported worldwide phenomenon of the proliferation of rodents accompanying the demographic decrease or even local extinction of large-bodied mammal species, these organisms may already be an increasing health threat in many regions of the world."
