abstract = "Ecological and evolutionary theories have proposed that species traits
   should be important in mediating species responses to contemporary
   climate change; yet, empirical evidence has so far provided mixed
   evidence for the role of behavioral, life history, or ecological
   characteristics in facilitating or hindering species range shifts. As
   such, the utility of trait-based approaches to predict species
   redistribution under climate change has been called into question. We
   develop the perspective, supported by evidence, that trait variation, if
   used carefully can have high potential utility, but that past analyses
   have in many cases failed to identify an explanatory value for traits by
   not fully embracing the complexity of species range shifts. First, we
   discuss the relevant theory linking species traits to range shift
   processes at the leading (expansion) and trailing (contraction) edges of
   species distributions and highlight the need to clarify the mechanistic
   basis of trait-based approaches. Second, we provide a brief overview of
   range shift-trait studies and identify new opportunities for trait
   integration that consider range-specific processes and intraspecific
   variability. Third, we explore the circumstances under which
   environmental and biotic context dependencies are likely to affect our
   ability to identify the contribution of species traits to range shift
   processes. Finally, we propose that revealing the role of traits in
   shaping species redistribution may likely require accounting for
   methodological variation arising from the range shift estimation process
   as well as addressing existing functional, geographical, and
   phylogenetic biases. We provide a series of considerations for more
   effectively integrating traits as well as extrinsic and methodological
   factors into species redistribution research. Together, these analytical
   approaches promise stronger mechanistic and predictive understanding
   that can help society mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate
   change on biodiversity.
   In this opinion piece, we explore under which circumstances species
   traits are expected to explain the rates and directions of species
   redistributions in response to climate change and discuss how future
   trait-based approaches may benefit from fully embracing the complexity
   of species range shifts. We provide a set of considerations that we hope
   will help identify the underlying drivers of species range shifts and
   develop effective strategies that support biodiversity conservation
   under climate change.image"
