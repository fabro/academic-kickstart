abstract = "Tropical lands harbour the highest number of species, resulting in the
   ubiquitous latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG). However, exceptions to
   this pattern have been observed in some taxa, explained by the
   interaction between the evolutionary histories and environmental factors
   that constrain species' physiological and ecological requirements. Here,
   we applied a deconstruction approach to map the detailed species
   richness patterns of Actinopterygian freshwater fishes at the class and
   order levels and to disentangle their drivers using geographical ranges
   and a phylogeny, comprising 77\% (12 557) of all described species. We
   jointly evaluated seven evolutionary and ecological hypotheses posited
   to explain the LDG: diversification rate, time for speciation,
   species-area relationship, environmental heterogeneity, energy,
   temperature seasonality and past temperature stability. We found
   distinct diversity gradients across orders, including expected, bimodal
   and inverse LDGs. Despite these differences, the positive effect of
   evolutionary time explained patterns for all orders, where species-rich
   regions are inhabited by older species compared to species-poor regions.
   Overall, the LDG of each order has been shaped by a unique combination
   of factors, highlighting the importance of performing a joint evaluation
   of evolutionary, historical and ecological factors at different
   taxonomic levels to reach a comprehensive understanding on the causes
   driving global species richness patterns."
