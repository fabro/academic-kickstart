abstract = "The deviation of expected relationships between taxonomic (TD),
   phylogenetic (PD), and functional (FD) diversity may inform about some
   processes (speciation, extinction, competition, and migration)
   responsible for current biodiversity patterns. We studied the
   relationship between different dimensions of bird diversity (TD, PD, and
   FD) of the Yucatan Peninsula (YP) in a context of future climate change.
   We used ecological niche models to predict the current and future
   potential distribution of 257 bird species of the YP and estimate their
   TD, PD, and FD. We calculated a standardized effect size of PD (SES.PD)
   and FD (SES.FD) to provide an estimation of phylogenetic and functional
   diversity, independent from species richness. Finally, we evaluated the
   effectiveness of the system of PAs comparing the observed diversity
   values in each PA versus what is expected for a null model. We found a
   positive correlation between PD and TD, and a negative correlation
   between FD and TD in the current and future scenarios. Finally, we found
   that none of the PAs protect more diversity of birds than expected by a
   null model. Our results suggest that macroevolutionary processes have
   played an important role in the composition of the current Yucatan
   Peninsula avian assemblages. Our assessment of the effectiveness of the
   PAs suggests the need to adopt an integrative approach to biodiversity
   conservation in the YP."
