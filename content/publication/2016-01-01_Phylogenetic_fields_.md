abstract = "Species co-occur with different sets of other species across their
   geographical distribution, which can be either closely or distantly
   related. Such co-occurrence patterns and their phylogenetic structure
   within individual species ranges represent what we call the species
   phylogenetic fields (PFs). These PFs allow investigation of the role of
   historical processes speciation, extinction and dispersal in shaping
   species co-occurrence patterns, in both extinct and extant species.
   Here, we investigate PFs of large mammalian species during the last 3
   Myr, and how these correlate with trends in diversification rates. Using
   the fossil record, we evaluate species' distributional and co-occurrence
   patterns along with their phylogenetic structure. We apply a novel
   Bayesian framework on fossil occurrences to estimate diversification
   rates through time. Our findings highlight the effect of evolutionary
   processes and past climatic changes on species' distributions and
   co-occurrences. From the Late Pliocene to the Recent, mammal species
   seem to have responded in an individualistic manner to climate changes
   and diversification dynamics, co-occurring with different sets of
   species from different lineages across their geographical ranges. These
   findings stress the difficulty of forecasting potential effects of
   future climate changes on biodiversity."
