abstract = "The region of central Veracruz is considered a biodiversity hotspot due
   to its high species richness and environmental heterogeneity, but only
   2\% of this region is currently protected. This study aimed to assess
   the current protected area system's effectiveness and to identify
   priority conservation areas for expanding the existing protected area
   system. We used the distribution models of 1186 species from three
   kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, and Fungi) together with ZONATION software,
   a conservation planning tool, to determine areas that could help expand
   the current network of protected areas. We applied three different
   parametrizations (including only species, using the boundary quality
   penalty, and using corridor connectivity). We found that protecting an
   additional 15\% of the area would increase, between 16.2\% and 19.3\%,
   the protection of the distribution area of all species. We propose that
   the regions with a consensus of the three parametrizations should be
   declared as new protected areas to expand 374 km(2) to the 216 km(2)
   already protected. Doing so would double the protected surface in
   central Veracruz. The priority areas identified in this study have more
   species richness, carbon stock values, natural vegetation cover, and
   less human impact index than the existing protected areas. If our
   identified priority areas are declared protected, we could expect a
   future recovery of endangered species populations for Veracruz. The
   proposed new protected areas are planned and designed as corridors
   connecting currently isolated protected areas to promote biodiversity
   protection."
