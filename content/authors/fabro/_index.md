I am interested in all things "macroecological". Macroecology is a synthetic research program that seeks to understand the emergent, statistical properties of complex ecological systems (e.g. ecological communities, complete biotas, biodiversity patterns) at broad spatial and temporal scales. I'm particularly interested in macroecological research owing to its integration between ecology, biogeography and more recently macroevolution, while considering processes at different scales, in order to explain geographic biodiversity patterns.
