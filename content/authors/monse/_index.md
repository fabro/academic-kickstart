I am a biologist from the Universidad Autónoma de Tlaxcala, where I studied the diversity of medium and large mammals in different land uses and vegetation located in the intermediate area between both Iztaccíhuatl-Popocatépetl and La Malinche National Parks. I am interested in macroecology, diversity patterns and the effect of anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity. My current research as MSc student at INECOL focuses on evaluating the spatial patterns of different dimensions of carnivore diversity and trying to understand how environmental and anthropogenic factors affect and determine the configuration of these patterns.
