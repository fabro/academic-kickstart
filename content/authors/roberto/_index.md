I am a biology graduate from the Faculty of Sciences of the Autonomous University of San Luis Potosí (FC-UASLP), Mexico and a Master of Science graduate from the Institute of Ecology A. C. (INECOL). My main interest is the study of bats, more specifically, bat bioacoustics, how they use and move through the landscape, their macroecological patterns and, of course, bat conservation. In my PhD at INECOL, I aim to describe the knowledge gaps present in the current study of bat functional traits, and how these gaps affect our understanding of their macroecological patterns and conservation. I have a great passion for scientific outreach and I am a big promoter of art as a way of communicating the importance of science to the general public.
