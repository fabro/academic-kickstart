Project summary:  Currently, it is discussed whether or not interactions have an effect on geographic patterns at large scales. Existing studies show contrasting results where trophic interactions appear to have an effect on geographic patterns of species richness. Therefore, my objectives are: i) to understand how the number of potential prey species and available body sizes increase the richness of carnivorous mammal species and ii) to test whether the relationship between the body size of predators and prey (predator- prey ratio) is related to its geographic and environmental co-occurrence.

Academic interests: 
I am highly interested in hypercarnivores (particularly big cats) trophic ecology and its relation to the environmental niche, social behavior and body size structure of its prey and potential competitors within its diversity field.

Personal interests: 
I am an enthusiast of mountaineering, reading, visual arts, and Zen Buddhism.
