I am a biologist from the University of Antioquia, where I also completed my master’s degree in biology. My academic path has focused on freshwater fishes, starting with community ecology studies in the northern Andes and later on species distribution and conservation of aquatic systems. I am now a PhD student at INECOL, where I study large-scale patterns of species distribution and richness using a biogeographic and macroecological approach, with a special focus on Neotropical freshwater fishes.
