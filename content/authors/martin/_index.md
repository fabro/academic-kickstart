I am very interested in the biology of mammals, particularly bats. I am fascinated by its great variety of forms, adaptations and diversity, as well as its ecology, evolution and geographical distribution. In my Bachelor's and Master's studies at the "Alfonso L. Herrera" Zoology Museum, I described the community of mammals that inhabit the ecosystems of Tetela de Ocampo, Puebla, and explored the population genetics of a species of bat (Sturnira parvidens) throughout their entire geographical range, respectively. I also worked as Collection Manager at the Vertebrate Collection of the Universidad Autónoma de Baja California and enjoyed learning about the unique biodiversity of Northwestern Mexico. Now, in my PhD, I want to describe and analyze the mode of evolution and the rates of change of wing morphology and the acoustic signal in bats, as well as their impact on its macroecological patterns on a global scale.
