Currently I am a PhD student at Instituto de Ecología A.C. (INECOL) within the Maevo Lab. My current work focuses on assessing the effects of the dispersion and dispersion capabilities of the new world’s Emberizoidea families (Aves:Passeriformes) on their diversification rates and patterns.

I did my Bsc at the Universidad Veracruzana, where I measured the genetic erosion of Sideroxylum celastrinum on a highly perturbed ecosystem in central Veracruz. My Msc (held also at INECOL) focused on the phylogenetic diversity and structure patterns of the New World’s seasonally dry tropical forests woody species.

My current main interests are to understand and address the processes and patterns that shaped the current species distributions and diversification, and how the former had changed over time.
