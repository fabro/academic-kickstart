I am a mammalogist and conservation scientist. I grew up in Mexico City, where I studied Biology at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México before earning a PhD at the University of Queensland, Australia. I have held research fellowships in Switzerland and Chile, and my current focus is on the ecology and evolution of small mammals. Additionally, I enjoy teaching and applying data cleaning, analysis, and visualization in the statistical programming language R. Find more about me at https://luisdva.github.io/
