I am a biologist with broad interest in several aspects of tropical ecology. Most of my experience has been from studying species diversity in tierra-firme (non-inundated) Amazonian forests in Brazil and in Andes of Ecuador. To understand broad aspects of species distribution, I got interested in remote sensing, biogeography and in the mapping of environmental conditions. The effects of anthropogenic impacts over species distribution have also come to my attention recently.  Currently I am living in Mexico, with my wife Mariana and my pets Pingo, Yuca and Sacha Mishi.
