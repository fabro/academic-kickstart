I am a graduated biologist from the “Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán” (UADY). I obtained a Master degree in the Faculty of Science from the “Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México” (UNAM). Now I’m studying a PhD in the same institution. In my previous studies I worked with ecological niche models to predict potential areas of ophidism risk in the Yucatan Peninsula based on environmental and sociodemographic factors and to evaluate different niche modeling protocols to improve the models transferring and fundamental niches’ characterization. My current research interests focus on understanding the factors shaping the species’ richness and distributions. Currently, I’m evaluating the evolutionary, ecological and geographical causes for the species richness patterns of the Spiny Lizards (genus Sceloporus).
