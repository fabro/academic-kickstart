I am an evolutionary biologist and herpetologist interested in understanding the environmental and historical factors shaping the geographical gradients of biodiversity through the lens of macroecology and macroevolution. Currently, I am a PhD student in the Evolutionary Macroecology Lab at the Instituto de Ecología (INECOL). For my PhD, I aim to evaluate the environmental correlates of endemism and lineage diversification gradients in the evolutionary radiation of a Neotropical lineage of lizards.
