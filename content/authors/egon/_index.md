I am a biologist with a M.Sc. degree from Universidade Federal de Uberlândia (UFU), Brazil. Currently, I am working on a research project as a Ph.D. student at Universidade Federal de Goiás (UFG). My research focuses on the role of evolution on geographic range size, climatic niche, and dispersion ability within species of the Chiroptera order. 

I am interested in everything about the Chiroptera order, but mostly its flight and bioacoustics evolution, and although I am not currently engaged on it, taxonomy and taxidermy.
